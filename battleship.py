# Battleship Game ‚Äî Solo mode with two boards, side-by-side, columns 1..N
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# What this version does:
# - Shows TWO boards side by side:
#     ‚Ä¢ Left  : Enemy board (you only see what you have discovered: X/O/~)
#     ‚Ä¢ Right : Your board (your ships are visible as 'S')
# - Columns are labeled 1..board_size (more natural for humans).
# - You type guesses like A1, C7, H8 (NOT A0).
# - Internally we still use 0-based indexing, so we convert (col-1).
# - Screen refreshes each turn so the view looks ‚Äúlive‚Äù.
# - This structure prepares us to add Enemy turns later.
